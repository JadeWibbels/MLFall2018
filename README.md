# Objective

The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) asks Kagglers to help prepare to classify the data from this new survey. Competitors will classify astronomical sources that vary with time into different classes, scaling from a small training set to a very large test set of the type the LSST will discover.
